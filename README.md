## Quick start
Train an object detection with Google Colab and free GPU.

Train with custom Pascal VOC dataset.
[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tony607/mmdetection_object_detection_demo/blob/master/mmdetection_train_custom_data.ipynb)

Train with custom COCO dataset.

*The `data/VOC2007` folder provides a reference structure of custom dataset ready for training. Fork my repository and replace them with your custom annotated dataset as necessary.*
